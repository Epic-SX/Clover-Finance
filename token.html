            <li><em>Private Sale: </em>20 million CLV (25%) will be distributed to private sale investors.

            <li><em>Initial Parachain Offering: </em>4 million CLV (5%) will be distributed for Polkadot parachain slot auction, also known as Initial Parachain Offering (IPO). To secure a parachain slot, Clover will require supportive DOT holders to lock their DOTs to bid for a slot, and CLV tokens will be distributed as rewards to DOT owners who participant in the IPO successfully. The detailed schedule will be determined when Polkadot starts Parachain slot auction activity.</li>

            <li><em>Clover Team: </em>12 million CLV (15%) will be distributed to the Clover team & advisors.

            <li><em>Clover Ecosystem Fund: </em>12 million CLV (15%) will be maintained as ecosystem fund. The fund can be used as grants to projects built within the Clover ecosystem, market liquidity provisions, and other Clover related activities. The usage of reserves will be decided by community governance and determined via voting processes.</li>
